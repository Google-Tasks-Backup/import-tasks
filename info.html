    <h3>Understanding the "Raw" data format</h3>
    
    <div class="break">
        Table 1 lists the various states and the corresponding task attribute values. It is possible to select to download only tasks which match specified task attributes when initiating a backup with {{ app_title }} 
    </div>

    <div class="break">
        Normally, when downloading for applications such as Outlook or iCalendar, uncheck <span class="take-note">deleted</span> and <span class="take-note">hidden</span> <span class="take-note-smaller">(note 1)</span>. Check <span class="take-note">completed</span> if you wish to include completed tasks (i.e., to keep a backup of your completed tasks).

There does not appear to be any way to force a task to be actually deleted. That is, the Trash bin cannot be emptied by the user.

            ** needsAction (unchecked)
            ---- Visible in main list

            ** completed (checked) {before clicking [Clear completed]}
            ---- Visible in main list 

            ** completed (checked) {after clicking [Clear completed]}
            ---- Visible only in [Completed tasks]

            ** Deleted
            ---- Visible only in [Trash]
            
        -> Marked complete, and then clicked Clear completed = completed, hidden
        -> Marked complete and deleted (appears in [Trash]) = completed, deleted
