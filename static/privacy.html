        <!-- <h2>Details</h2> -->
        <h2>Collection and usage of data</h2>
        
        <div>
            In order to provide this service, the user is authenticated with Google, which provides GTI with the following;
            <ul>
                <li>Temporary access to be able to add and delete tasks for the user
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is required in order to be able to import tasks</li>
                        <li>Access to a user's tasks automatically expires, as specified during the Google authentication process</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The user's name and email address
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the name and email address associated with the Google account that is used when the user authenticates with Google</li>
                        <li>GTI uses the email address to send an email when the import process is complete</li>
                        <li>The account name and email address is stored in logs, which may be used by the system administrator to investigate user-reported problems</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>           
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            To use GTI, the user uploads a file containing tasks to be imported into the user's Google Tasks.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The uploaded file is temporarily stored by GTI, and then data for each task is read from the uploaded file and a new task is then created for each row of task data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When all tasks have been created, the temporary file is deleted.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Data security</h3>
        <div>
            GTI uses standard HTTPS for all communications between the browser and the GTI application. 
        </div>
        
        <h3>Server logs</h3>
        
        <div>
            Google App Engine automatically logs information about each request to GTI. This information includes;
            <ul>
                <li>Time of the request</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>User name</li>
                <li>Browser version</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            If task creation fails, the details of the task that failed may be stored in the server log, along with the user's email address, to enable debugging and application improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only system administrators have access to server logs. The user's task details and email address will not be shared with anyone.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        
        <div>
            Cookies are used for two purposes in GTI;

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Location</h3>
