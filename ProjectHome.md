**Import Google Tasks** allows tasks to be imported into **Google Tasks** from either a GTBak or Import/Export CSV file, as exported by **Google Tasks Backup** (https://tasks-backup.appspot.com)

The **GTBak** file type is recommended when importing, especially if tasks are likely to contain international or extended characters.

The one advantage that the Import/Export CSV file has is that it can be edited in a text editor such as [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) before importing. Refer to http://import-tasks.appspot.com/info for details of the Import/Export CSV file format.
